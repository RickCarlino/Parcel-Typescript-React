# Typescript Boilerplate

A boilerplate that has all of the things I want for one-off prototypes of things.

# TODO

 * Index page that creates a thing.
 * List view page that shows things.
 * Add bootstrap, maybe.

# Develop

# Production Builds

This is intended for hobby projects. No build pipeline is provided other than `webpack-dev-server`.

# Typescript Boilerplate

A boilerplate that has all of the things I want for one-off prototypes of things.

# TODO

 * Index page that creates a thing.
 * List view page that shows things.
 * Add bootstrap, maybe.

# Develop

```
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).

Dev away!

# Production Builds

Coming soon!

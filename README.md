# Typescript Boilerplate

A boilerplate that has all of the things I want for one-off prototypes of things.

Also, **I'm learning Parcel.JS and this is where I try things out**. Please don't use this boilerplate to build your next startup, OK?

# TODO

 * Jest tests
 * State management
 * Coverage tools n such.

# Develop

```
yarn install
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234).

Dev away!

# Production Builds

Coming soon!
